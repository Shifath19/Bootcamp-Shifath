                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  Provides all necessary information, and everything is clear for the user.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 :</strong>

                  Good. The background color is easy on the eyes, and it aligns with the aesthetic and layout choices
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 :</strong>

                  The background color works well, but an alternative color for the code would help, as the current one can be visually straining.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Phenomenal. The information complements each sub-exercise, and the layout is consistent. The color choices are impressive.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 </strong>
                  The dark and light theme colors complement each other, and the overall information structure is great. Itâ€™s visually pleasing and aesthetically on point.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>consistent with the other solutions

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 :</strong> The color scheme complements the icons well.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 :</strong> This works as intended.
                  Would be better if he actually provided which row was
                  which.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> One of the best solutions. The download and upload buttons are functional, but better icons could replace the current ones.

                  <strong>Level 1 and 2:</strong> Designs, layouts, and styling are good. More context and information on image properties would have been helpful.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>Simple and concise, with all necessary context provided.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Exactly like the original site. The landing page is great with consistent styling, making it both aesthetically and visually pleasing.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Very good. Adding the date of publication would have made the article more informative.

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong> The flow of information is strong, and images are provided for better understanding.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong>The redesign of the IRCTC website and the Press Release page follows the styling and layout well and is aesthetically pleasing. Nitpick: The press release page lacks a date.
