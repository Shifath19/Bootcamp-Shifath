                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>
                  The transition from 1.1 to 1.3 was smooth and well done. The font information in 1.1 was placed at the top, making it easy to access without extra effort. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>
                  The code has a solid color scheme, and the typography is well executed. The background color complements the font, and the header design works well. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The color choice is excellent—visually pleasing and aesthetic. The font choice is also solid, and the margins and spacing are perfect.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                </p>

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  The color scheming card exercises are some of the best and most informative I’ve seen. It provides all necessary information without requiring additional effort from the user. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>
                  The dark and light theme colors complement each other well, creating a visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing result. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The only issue is the text inside the gradient box; everything else is well done. The information structure is clear, and all needed details are provided.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>9</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> This is one of the best implementations I’ve seen for this website. The icons fit well with the overall dark mode design. They also provide information about which icons have been used in the paragraph.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> : This could be improved by specifying which rows are SVGs and which are icons for clearer differentiation.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The navbar is well-designed. All buttons are present, properly spaced, and feature suitable icons with good margin and padding.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The first level is good and provides all necessary information, though it could be improved with additional context on image sizing.<a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> responsive and clean. Great display of images. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> implemented the lazy loading really well <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The article is well-structured, following all the necessary principles. The information flows logically, and no extra effort is required to access additional details. <a href="https://bootcamp-sonia-shaik.netlify.app/design/ex-5/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This is great, though adding the publication date would have been helpful for understanding when the article was released.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The annotations provide useful context, explaining why certain visual choices on the website were poor.

                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The UI/UX comparison is excellent, and the information structure aligns well with the design choices made.

                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The redesign features optimal spacing, as well as appropriate font and color choices.
