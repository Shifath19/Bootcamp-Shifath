                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>
                  information was presented in clean way while maintaining the layout and Responsiveness. <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-1/solution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>
                  Looks clean but a little bit of more
                  styling is needed for the spacing. <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-1/solution-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  This is much better ,improved the spacing and good choice of fonts <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-1/solution-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  The transition from Level 1.1 to Level 1.3 was smooth and consistent. The colors used are easy on the eyes, and the information is presented clearly and is easy to grasp. However, the color combinations could use some improvement to create better visual harmony.

                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>
                  The content does not change color; only the background does, which feels inaccurate and inconsistent with expectations. <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-2/solution-2-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The color swatch is well-designed and visually appealing. Adding more detailed information or context about the swatch would make it even more valuable. <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-2/solution-2-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The icons placed beside the headings are a nice touch, but the overall styling of the page could be improved to make it more visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing.<a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-3/solution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>The icon grid at the end could be clearer with distinct information differentiating between icons and SVGs. This would enhance clarity and usability.<a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-3/solution-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The header could be further improved with better color choices to make it stand out and look more polished. Additionally, the background color choices could be refined for a more cohesive and aesthetic design.<a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-3/solution-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>The responsive Google Article Clone works well, but it still feels barebones. It could benefit from enhanced styling using appropriate design techniques to make it more visually appealing. <a href="http://vadlamaniuday.surge.sh/design/ex-2-5/solution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The article is well-structured and clear. Adding more content and including the upload date on the side of the card would make it more informative and polished..

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>In the Annotations exercise, the styling could be improved by utilizing a grid layout instead of the current vertical layout, which would enhance both structure and visual appeal.
