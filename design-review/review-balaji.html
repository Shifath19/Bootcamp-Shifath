                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  The transition between 1.1 to 1.3 is impressive. All changes were well-documented.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  From a basic website to a modern one, following all aesthetic structures. Enjoyed reading it.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  The color scheme transition could be improved (pink to blue). Staying with a single color would enhance the visual consistency.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  Excellent choice of colors in dark mode; they are easy on the eyes.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The color swatch generator is well-implemented and provides structured information.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Great use of color, and the icons complement it well.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>Works as intended, but providing more clarity on which row corresponds to which icon would have been useful.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>Excellent solution. The download and upload buttons are complemented with appropriate icons and context.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>  Good job adding information about the changes made.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Could have added image properties along with the compressed image properties for more clarity.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>Simple, concise, and does what it needs to.

                  The Medium clone looks like real deal,  with just HTML and CSS. Perfect spacing and margins, following all the guidelines.

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. Annotated images would have been a nice addition. The UI/UX comparison of Amazon/Flipkart would have been better with just the winner instead of using two different colors.

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>  The redesign is very good. The hover effect and modern interface work well. Providing small context for the content inside adds value.
