                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  The content and styling are good, and the information is present. However, it doesnâ€™t fully adhere to the guidelines for the CSS Zen Garden Template.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 :</strong>

                  This is actually good. Has a background color which is easy to
                  the eye and follows all of the aesthetic and layout choices.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 :</strong>

                  Should have followed the docs in detail.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Good. The information complements each sub-exercise, with consistent layout and styling across the board.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 </strong>

                  Very good. The color choice in dark mode is easy on the eyes and works well.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3</strong>
                  The HSL approach is great and provides all necessary details. The gradients complement the background color and are aesthetically pleasing.

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong> Level 1 & 2::</strong>  The icons are subtle and blend well with the content and styling but did not use SVGs, as mentioned in Level 2.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The icons in the download and upload buttons are visually appealing with an aesthetic gradient.

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>Provides useful information about the images, but it would benefit from more details on image properties.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>Lacks details on compressed images, but the styling and layout are consistent.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Simple, concise and does what it was
                  supposed to do and also provides the additional context.

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The article is well done, though adding context about the images would improve it. The visual styling is appreciated.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The article is solid, but it would be improved with more content and a publication date next to the card.

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> Very good, especially with the image annotations. The UI/UX comparison of Amazon/Flipkart could benefit from more consistent styling.<br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong> The redesign is great. The hover effect and modern interface give the IIT-M page an updated, aesthetic look.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign for the webpages are really good and looks clean.
