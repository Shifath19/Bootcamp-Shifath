          Text spacing and styles provide good readability. But the text used doesnt provide the required context. The choice of colors for themes do not compliment each other. I feel like he was preoccupied with something thats why the solutions feel rushed.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  Did not add Js code as specified by the rules.
                  Font color makes it difficult to read through the paragraph. <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                Looks clean but a little bit of more
                  styling is needed. <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Did not implement typographic hierarchy as asked in the rules. The new font is much better <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-1/solution1-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                </p>

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Implements all of the information which was asked.
                  But the information is strucutured properly and the color theme could be much better. <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The theme switch works smoothly but the layout is very poor <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Clearly explained the HSL values individually but the layout is not aligned properly <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-2/solution2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>It's just three icons in a page no headers or main section.Does not explain whats the purpose of the page. <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution3-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Same as level 1.it would be
                  beneficial if there was some context and proper sizing <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution3-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The page does not use icons as asked in rules. Same as solution 1 and 2 the page has no context for what is being<a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-3/solution3-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

              <td>3</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The page just has three images without any styling. The sizing of the images is inconsistent.Does not implement the functionality asked in rules Should have used attributes like "cover", "contain" <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution4-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This solution is responsive. But the hero section is blank without any text.Used Lorem text which provides no context of the solution <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution4-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Just an image. Additional context
                  would've been benificial. <a href="https://boothcamp-abhijeet.netlify.app/design/ex-4/solution4-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Not present
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The layout looks good and is also responsive but the content and theme is really poor.
                  The font doesnt do any justice to the page.
                  It just looks like a boilerplate generated by a Gpt.

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>Does what is specified in the docs.
                  Only one screenshot is used from the website. The theme okay.
                  The listed critics of the wensite are honest and insightful.

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Redesign was actually very good. I liked the idea of making each article into its own card. The design is clean and easier to read.
                  Provides context for each article.
