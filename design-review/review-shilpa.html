          Some of the solutions are really well designed while other lack the same consistency. Should include more detailed information and context for the solution.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>
                  Level 1 was good. They used the CSS Zen Garden template and added a snippet of JS code, styling it accordingly. <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-1/solution1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>
                  The changes were explained, but it could be improved by sticking more closely to the CSS Zen template for better consistency.<a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-1/solution2-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  Should have continued on same design for consistency <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-1/solution3-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  This is excellent. The information complements each sub-exercise, and the layout and styling are consistent throughout. <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-2/solution1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>
                  The design is good overall, though one nitpick is that the card doesnâ€™t change its theme when switching from dark to light mode, which makes it hard on the eyes when using dark mode. Otherwise, it works well. <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-2/solution2-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The color swatch is well-executed. It provides all necessary information while maintaining consistent styling and layout without sacrificing detail <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-2/solution3-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>It would have been helpful if more context about the icons was provided. <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-3/solution1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Same as level 1.it would be
                  beneficial if there was some context and proper sizing <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-3/solution2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The download and upload buttons are just buttons. It would be better to use actual download and upload icons for clarity.<a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/design/ex-3/solution3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>The points about the problems with the IRCTC website are valid and well-made. However, supporting them with images or annotations would make it even better. This is a minor nitpick.

                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>The redesign of the IRCTC website can be improved and would benefit from better images. However, the information flow and structure are solid and well-executed.
