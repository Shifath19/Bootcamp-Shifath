                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  Good. It meets the requirements but does not follow the CSS Zen Garden template guidelines.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Improvements in aesthetics were made, but it still didn't follow the Zen Garden template.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Provides the required information, but the structure could be improved, especially in distinguishing code from regular paragraphs.
                </p>

              <td>7</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Good. Layout, margins, padding, and font spacing are on point. Reading the content is easy and pleasant
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The theme switcher doesn't work, and the button doesn't perform any action, making this exercise functional but flawed.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Aesthetically pleasing, but lacks functionality in Level 2, which impacted the overall result.
                  <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. The icons match the color choices well. A bit of context would improve the experience.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong>Clearer identification of which row corresponds to which icon would improve understanding, as the mix of SVGs and images isn't ideal.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Simple and concise. The color scheme complements the icons and background, working well overall.

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>  Good, but additional information about changes made would help.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Good, but adding details on image properties, including compression, would be beneficial.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Missing
                  <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>  Good article layout. Adding context about the image would improve it. Visual styling is liked.<br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Good article layout. Would benefit from more content and adding the date of publication.<br />
