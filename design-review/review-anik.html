                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>
                  Provided the font weights and styles used in the webpage as asked in the docs. The JS code is missing.<a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-1/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>
                  Looks clean with good spacing ,provides good readability. <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-1/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  Did not implement typographic hierarchy as asked in the rules. The new font is much better <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-1/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>
                  Implements all of the information which was asked.
                  But the information is not strucutured properly and the color theme could be much better. <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-2/solution-2-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>
                  The theme switch works smoothly but layout could be improvided. <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-2/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The color choice for button and gradient could have been better <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-2/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>The webpage doesnt have any icons <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-3/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This is better implements the required design but doesnt add context to which icon is whichh. <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-3/solution-2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The design is great, looks clean. Could have added more styles to the icons<a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-3/solution-2-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> The layout is structured well but could have added more styles such as spaicng and imgs. <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/design/ex-2-5/solution-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Link</a>
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The font color is not readable due to contrast with header
