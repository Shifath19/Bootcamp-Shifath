          Follows a consistent styling for each solution but across different exercises the styling is a bit off.
          Went for a clean minimalistic design for overall exercise. But the color choices for some solutions could be greatly improved

                Uses different template for the exercise instead of the CSS Zen-Garden. 
                The web is designed with a better readability but styles could be improved a lot.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Follows the instructions very well but failed to make the 1.1 to 1.3 solutions linked through 
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The context provided is inadequate. But the overall use of colors is not bad
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The overall selection of the color theme could be improved.
                  <br />
                </p>

              <td>7</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>Use of icons wrt to the context of the text is good but the icons can use some more styling.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The SVG does not complement the color theme; it could benefit from a better color choice.Simply poor choice .
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Same as solution 2 , the svg color choice is very poor.

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 and 2:</strong>The use of images here were
                  good. The warm palette is really great but need more information wrt to what is happening in the page.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> This page is well made the layout is great and the iamges have alt text when the loading takes times.
                  <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>The article layout is good, adhering to article post principles. The information flows correctly without additional work needed from the user. But could have used better color choices for the cards.<br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The cards are well designed , the smooth hovers are nice touch. The color theme is good.
                  The mistake here is that the text doesnt add any value to the page,
                  <br />
                </p>

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> This is good. Provided appropriate
                  annotations as to what is wrong when it comes to design
                  choices .The images are direct screenshots of the whole page so  they could have used better styling.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>The page is hard to navigate because the color for text and backgrounds do not compliment each other.<br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign for the IRCTC website
                  can be done better and can be complimented with better images.
                  The redesign of Faculty About Me page is actually good and
                  provides all of the appropriate context and information needed
                  about the person
                  <br />
