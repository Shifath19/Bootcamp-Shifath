    1. Use of clamp() for Fluid Typography:
Why clamp()?

The clamp() function is used to create responsive typography that scales proportionally based on the viewport size. It allows us to set a minimum, preferred, and maximum value for the font size
  </p>

  <p>
    Use of vw, vh, and rem for Scalable Layout and Spacing:
vw (Viewport Width) and vh (Viewport Height):

These units are based on the size of the viewport, making them useful for creating fluid layouts that adjust according to screen dimensions.
vw: 1vw equals 1% of the viewport's width.
vh: 1vh equals 1% of the viewport's height.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fluid Layout and Continuous Responsiveness:
No Fixed Breakpoints:
Traditional responsive design often relies on fixed breakpoints (e.g., @media queries for 768px, 1024px, etc.), but this design avoids them by using fluid units like vw, vh, and clamp(). This ensures that the layout adjusts continuously across all screen sizes without the need for predefined breakpoints.
