      <h4>Review Overview</h4>
      <div id="tldr">
        <p>
      The SKB research website implemets a very well functioning app that lets the user search through the papers by filters such as title, year and citations.But the design looks very pale and outdated. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <!-- Rest of the content remains the same -->
        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The website's layout is clean and well-organized, using a grid system for easy navigation and quick scanning of research papers. The search bar and filter options are positioned at left side for easy access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The site offers well-organized and user-friendly filter options for title, citations, and year ranges, effectively refining search results and enhancing site functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The  results are
          displayed in a clear and readable format in a grid layout. Each card
          contains essential information such as Authos, citations, abstract, year and references.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The current color scheme, while visually appealing and professional, could be improved for better contrast and visual interest in the card design. Implementing a theme switcher functionality would also enhance user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Export Data" button is clearly
          labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to export their
          search results. However, the pagination numbers are not clearly visible and could be improved for better user experience.
        </p>


        <h4>4. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bar allows users to
          search by various criteria, making it easy to find specific research
          papers. The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results by Author, year, citations.
        </p>


        <h4>Improvements</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhancing Visual Appeal:</strong> To elevate the user experience, incorporating subtle visual elements or nuanced color variations could make the interface more captivating and interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dynamic Filtering:</strong> Implementing dynamic filters that adapt to user input would significantly enhance the search functionality. Additionally, including filters for abstracts and the ability to search across all columns would provide users with more comprehensive search capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refining Styling:</strong> Building upon the existing professional and clean aesthetic, introducing thoughtful visual elements or subtle color variations could further enrich the interface, making it more engaging and user-friendly.
