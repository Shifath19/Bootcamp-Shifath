**Collaborative Annotation System Design Document
Problem Definition:**

The system aims to create a foundational framework for building collaborative web applications where users can interact with, visualize, and annotate various types of data produced by computational tools and AI/LLM systems. This is not just a domain-specific solution but a platform-level framework that other applications can build upon.

**Core Requirements**

    Authentication system for user management
    Generic, extensible component system for data visualization
    Annotation capabilities for collaborative feedback
    Modular and extensible architecture

**Key Challenges**

    Creating a flexible yet structured JSON format for component definitions
    Building an extensible component registry system
    Managing component state and annotations
    Implementing secure user authentication
    Designing an intuitive annotation interface

**Users and Use Cases:**

Developers

    Integrate the framework into their applications
    Create custom components
    Define composite widgets
    Configure authentication and annotation features

End Users

    View and interact with data visualizations
    Add annotations and comments
    Collaborate with other users
    Navigate through different views and components

**User Flow**

    User logs in via credentials or OTP
    System loads user preferences and permissions
    User interacts with various components (tables, graphs, etc.)
    User adds annotations to supported components
    Annotations persist and are visible to other users
    Users can modify or delete their annotations

**Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Foundation**

    Set up Next.js project with authentication
        Implement credential-based login
        Implement OTP-based login
        Configure session management
        Set up SQLite database

    Create basic component system
        Define JSON schema for components
        Implement component registry
        Create base table component
        Create base text component

**Phase 2: Core Features**

        Enhance component system
        Implement composite widgets
        Add graph component
        Add card component
        Create component registration system

    Build annotation system
        Design annotation data structure
        Implement annotation UI
        Create annotation storage system
        Add edit/delete capabilities

**Phase 3: Integration & Polish**

    Component enhancements
        Add customization options
        Implement layout system
        Add responsive design
        Create additional components

    System integration
        Connect all modules
        Implement error handling
        Add loading states
        Create documentation

**Exit Criteria**

Authentication Module

    Users can log in using credentials or OTP
    Sessions persist for configured duration
    User preferences are stored and retrieved
    Password reset functionality works

Component System

    Components can be defined using JSON
    New components can be registered dynamically
    Composite widgets work as expected
    Components render correctly with different data types

Annotation System

    Users can add annotations to supported components
    Annotations persist in the database
    Users can edit and delete their annotations
    Annotations are visible to other users
