    What I Gained
Improved HTML Semantics and Accessibility I learned the importance of using semantic HTML elements like <strong>header</strong> , <strong>Footer</strong>, <strong>article</strong>, and <strong>aside</strong>. This practice not only improves SEO but also enhances accessibility, making websites more user-friendly for screen readers.

<br>

Mastering Modern CSS Layouts (Flexbox & Grid) Through various tutorials, I gained a solid understanding of Flexbox and CSS Grid. These tools have made it easier to create responsive layouts, improving my ability to design websites that work well on different screen sizes.
<br>
Deepening Knowledge of React and State Management By exploring React through resources like This Week in React, I learned more about React's component-based structure and state management. I got hands-on experience with React hooks like useState and useEffect, as well as advanced state management tools like Redux, which improved my ability to build dynamic, interactive web apps.
