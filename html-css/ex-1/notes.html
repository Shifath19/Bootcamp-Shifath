      <p>1. Approach to the Problem: Since it was a simple html page I used chatGpt to get the syntax of sematic html and html tables. Then built the webpage on referencing the examples.

<!-- 1. SEMATIC ELEMENTS IN HTML

Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning in a way that is easy for both developers and browsers to understand.

 Some of Semantic Elements:

      <header>: Contains introductory content like a logo, navigation, or title.

      <footer>: Defines a footer for a document or section.

      <article>: Represents an independent piece of content.

      <section>: Groups related content thematically.

      <nav>: Defines navigation links.

      <aside>: Content related to the main content but not essential (e.g., sidebars).


2. Using CSS and JavaScript in HTML

  Adding CSS:
      Inline CSS: using a <style> attribute in a tag 

      Internal CSS: Add <style> tag in the <head>:

      External CSS: Link a .css file using <link>:

  Adding JavaScript:

      Inline JS: Adding JS  inside an  attribute

      Internal JS: Adding JS inside a <script> tag

      External JS: Link a .js file:



3. Mistakes in HTML

      Missing closing tags.

      Improper nesting of tags.

      Invalid attributes.

Results of Mistakes:

      The page might still render but not as expected.
      Certain functionalities or styling may break.

Validating HTML:

      We can use Inspect or Console in the browser window
      We can copy-paste the code into a GPT for validation. -->
