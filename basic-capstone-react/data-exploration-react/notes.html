    <h1>Project Notes</h1>

    <h2>Thought Process</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly application for searching and filtering academic papers. 
        The design focused on providing a clean interface while ensuring that users could easily apply various filters 
        to narrow down their search results. The use of React allowed for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing a robust filtering system that could handle multiple criteria without performance issues.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the UI remained intuitive while adding more filter options like title and abstract.</li>
        <li>Maintaining a consistent design across different components while allowing for customization.</li>
        <li>Debugging issues related to state management in React, especially when dealing with multiple filters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functionalities Implemented</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Search functionality across authors, titles, and abstracts.</li>
        <li>Dynamic filtering based on user input with real-time updates to the displayed results.</li>
        <li>Pagination to manage large sets of results effectively.</li>
        <li>Export functionality to download filtered results in JSON format.</li>
        <li>Responsive design to ensure usability on various devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>LLMs Used</h2>
   I mainly used Cursor IDE for generating code snippets, providing explanations, and assisting with debugging.
