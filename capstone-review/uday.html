      <h4>Review Overview</h4>
      <div id="tldr">
        <p>
        The design is sleek and pleasing on the eyes, the filters work very well. The card for each paper is well designed it displays all the data without clustering it. Could have addded more filter options.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <!-- Rest of the content remains the same -->
        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The website's layout is clean, well-organized, and optimized for easy navigation. A grid system is employed to display research papers in a clear and concise manner, facilitating quick scanning of multiple entries. The search bar and filter options are strategically positioned at the top, making it easy for users to locate specific content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The filter options for title, citations, and year ranges are well-organized and user-friendly. They provide an effective way for users to refine their search results, enhancing the overall functionality of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The  results are
          displayed in a clear and readable format in a grid layout. Each card
          contains essential information such as Authos, citations, abstract, year and references.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The light theme background paired with dark text produces a visually appealing and professional aesthetic. This color scheme is gentle on the eyes, promoting readability. However, the theme switcher functionality is currently unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Export Data" button is clearly
          labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to export their
          search results. The pagination controls at the bottom are also
          well-designed.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Content</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Detail Level:</strong> The content is comprehensive and
          well-structured.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usefulness:</strong> Easy to navigate and export the filtered the data.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bar allows users to
          search by various criteria, making it easy to find specific research
          papers. The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results by Author, year, citations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the search results and filters. The
          pagination at the top is well-placed and easy to use, allowing
          users to browse through multiple pages of results.
        </p>

        <h4>Improvements</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Visual Engagement:</strong> While the design is clean and
          professional, adding some visual elements or slight variations in
          color could make the interface more engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filter Options:</strong> The filter options could be implemeted dynamically. The filters for abstract and search through all coloums are missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Styling Suggestions:</strong> The current styling is professional and clean, but adding some visual elements or slight variations in color could make the interface more engaging.
